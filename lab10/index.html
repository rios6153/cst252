	<h1> Art & Suzy's Lab 10:<span id="title"> JavaScript Events and Forms</span></h1>
	<p>Working together, we experimented with writing functions that take user input.</p>

	<h2> Challenge</h2>
	<p> Really no challenge.</p>

	<h2> Problems</h2>
	<p> It just took a little while to get the JavaScript correct. We struggle a bit and at one point our text wasn't showing
		until we noticed our font color was needed to be change and everything worked out from there. It was a small issue like always but
	we were happy that we figured it out.</p>

	<h2> Results</h2>
	<p> We are happy with the results, we were able to figure the output we wanted and created our own name badge :) Here are our results:</p>
<div>
	<input type="text" id="user-name"><br>
              <button id="my-button">Submit</button>
              <div id="output"></div>

	 </div>
	<div class="linkbox">
	<a class="homelink" href="../index.html">Back to Art's homepage</a>
