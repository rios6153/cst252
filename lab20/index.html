        <p>Working with your partner, experiment with processing JSON from an API.</p>

        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>This lab was troublesome, it took a lot of our time figuring out how it all works in Javascript.
				We don't fully understand the ajax method so we did researched and most of the things we found were not helpful.
			We are happy with our results but this lab took us more than 4hours for each of us.</p>
